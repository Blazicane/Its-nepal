<img src="flag.png" height=450 width=450>
<p title="About Nationals">The national flag of Nepal (Nepali: नेपालको झण्डा) is the world's only non-quadrilateral national flag.[2] The flag is a simplified combination of two single pennons, the vexillological word for a pennant. Its crimson red is the colour of the rhododendron, the country's national flower. Red is also the sign of victory in war. The blue border is the colour of peace. Until 1962, the flag's emblems, the sun and the crescent moon, had human faces. They were removed to modernize the flag.</p>

<img src="Emblem.png" height=450 width=450>
<p>The emblem of Nepal was changed during the reconciliation period following the Nepalese Civil War. On 30 December 2006, a new coat of arms was introduced. It contains the flag of Nepal, Mount Everest, green hills symbolising the hilly regions of Nepal and yellow colour symbolising the fertile Terai region, male and female hands joining to symbolise gender equality, and a garland of rhododendrons (the national flower). Atop this is a white silhouette in the shape of Nepal. In 2020, a new revised coat of arms was introduced.</p>
